Exception hanlding in java
Write a Java program that takes two integers as input and performs division. The program should handle exceptions for invalid input (non-integer input) and division by zero. The program should continue to prompt the user for valid input until successful division is performed.



Requirements:

Handle InputMismatchException if the user inputs non-integer values.
Handle ArithmeticException if the user attempts to divide by zero.
Use a loop to ensure the program continues to prompt the user until valid input is received and the division is successfully performed.

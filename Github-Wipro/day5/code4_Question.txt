Generic Data Analysis using JAVA
Description:
You are working on a data analysis module that needs to process different types of data. Implement a class named DataAnalyzer with the following requirements:


Constructor:

The class should have a constructor that takes an array of type T as its parameter and initializes an internal data structure to store the provided array.

Calculate Average Method:

Implement a method named calculateAverage that calculates and returns the average of the elements in the array.
Ensure that the method works for numeric types (e.g., Integer, Double) and does not require a separate implementation for each type.
Find Maximum Method:

Implement a method named findMaximum that finds and returns the maximum element in the array.
Ensure that the method works for comparable types (e.g., Integer, String) and does not require a separate implementation for each type.
Data Summary Method: (Pre-Implemented as a Boiler Plate Code)

Implement a method named dataSummary that prints a summary of the data, including the average and maximum values.


Sample Input:

45.9

46.8

57.3

37.8

Sample Output:

Data Summary:

Average: 46.95

Maximum: 57.3
